      WHO WE ARE
    </h1>
    <p class="text regular">
      Message in a Melody is a student-run organization at UCLA that hosts
      music-centric social events to raise money for pediatric cancer research.
      Using the power of live music, MIM fosters a tight-knit community of passionate
      students and fights cancer by supporting the Pediatric Oncology Department
      at Mattel Children's Hospital. Past MIM events have featured upcoming
      and high profile performers such as Anna Lunoe, Autograf, and Brownies & Lemonade.

      STARTED IN 2014
    </h1>
    <p class="text regular">
      Message in a Melody began as a fundraising campaign and benefit concert
      created by the Electronic Dance Music Club at UCLA. This idea was spearheaded by
      Elizabeth Matusov who was inspired by the courage her high school friend, Ashley
      Jensen-Pray, showed in her fight against a rare form of soft tissue cancer. Although
      Ashley passed away in December 2013, her story lives on with Message in a Melody,
      touching the hearts of all those around her and the entire UCLA community.
      <br><br>
      All members in EDMC had been personally affected by cancer, whether through friends
      or family members. Inspired by Ashley, EDMC members took action as an UCLA
      student group to reach out and bring forth this powerful cause to our fellow peers and
      inspire change.
      <br><br>
      Message in a Melody's first benefit concert was hosted in the Ackerman Grand
      Ballroom, located on the UCLA Campus on May 26, 2014. Featuring DJ and producer
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kastle">Kastle</a> and two student DJs,
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bvsd">BVSD</a> and <a href="http://www.thomrugo.com/">Thom Rugo</a>,
      the benefit concert was an incredible success, with over 250 attendees. A cancer wall was
      also created in the time leading up to the benefit concert, allowing the UCLA community
      to sign the huge wall for anyone they know that has been affected by cancer. This
      aggregation of support was displayed on the night of the benefit concert, showing the
      strength in our community against cancer.

    </h1>
    <p class="text regular">
      Inspired by the success of the 2014 campaign, Message in a Melody 2015
      continued to raise funds and awareness for pediatric cancer. Whereas the original
      team only consisted of five amazing members, the team grew to to twenty
      individuals. The team shifted the campaign's focus from music to education and
      awareness on childhood cancer, although music remained an integral part of Message in a
      Melody. The 2015 benefit concert featured
      <a href="https://soundcloud.com/anna-lunoe">Anna Lunoe</a>,

        A Poem by Ashley Jensen-Pray
      </h1>
      <p class="text poem italic">
        She was just another teenage girl,                  <br>
        Filled with youth and curiosity,                    <br>
        One day she came to discover,                       <br>
        What never seemed like a possibility.               <br>
        Her world fell apart like never before,             <br>
        And all she could do was watch idly by,             <br>
        She wanted to run the other way,                    <br>
        But instead she got ready to fight.                 <br>
        She knew she was a fighter,                         <br>
        For her life had never been easy,                   <br>
        But she found an unknown strength within,           <br>
        That not even she could believe.                    <br>
        The cancer tried its hardest,                       <br>
        To wither her away to nothing,                      <br>
        But she had a fire in her eyes,                     <br>
        Her life wasn't for the taking.                     <br>
        She fought her battle every day,                    <br>
        Going through the tunnel to get to the light,       <br>
        She was a warrior with a passion for life,          <br>
        By being relentless, she did it..she won the fight. <br>
        <br>
