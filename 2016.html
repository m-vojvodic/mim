            WHO WE ARE
        </h1>
        <p class="text regular">
            The Electronic Dance Music Club (EDMC) at UCLA is an on-campus
            organization, founded in 2012 that aims to provide DJ's, producers, and fans with a safe
            space to learn and practice their skills and discuss their interests in the growing music
            field around us. We share our interests and talents with the rest of campus and the Los
            Angeles community by hosting and DJ'ing various events on campus and around LA. We
            have also been able to bring popular artists to our campus for student enjoyment, some of
            which including Singularity, Nutrik, and Paul Oakenfold. As a club, we have grown
            exponentially in the last couple years. Starting last year, we felt that we could use our
            talents for something greater than ourselves. And thus, we put together a campaign to
            benefit the community.
            <br><br>

            STARTED IN 2014
        </h1>
        <p class="text regular">
            Message in a Melody is a fundraising campaign and benefit concert
            created by the Electronic Dance Music Club at UCLA. This idea was spearheaded by
            Elizabeth Matusov who was inspired by the courage her high school friend, Ashley
            Jensen-Pray, showed in her fight against a rare form of soft tissue cancer. Although
            Ashley passed away in December 2013, her story lives on with Message in a Melody,
            touching the hearts of all those around her and the entire UCLA community.
            <br><br>
            All members in EDMC have been personally affected by cancer, whether through friends
            or family members. Inspired by Ashley, EDMC members took action as an UCLA
            student group to reach out and bring forth this powerful cause to our fellow peers and
            inspire change.
            <br><br>
            Message in a Melody's first benefit concert was hosted in the Ackerman Grand
            Ballroom, located on the UCLA Campus on May 26, 2014. Featuring DJ and producer
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kastle">Kastle</a> and two student DJs,
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bvsd">BVSD</a> and <a href="http://www.thomrugo.com/">Thom Rugo</a>,
            the benefit concert was an incredible success, with over 250 attendees. A cancer wall was
            also created in the time leading up to the benefit concert, allowing the UCLA community
            to sign the huge wall for anyone they know that has been affected by cancer. This
            aggregation of support was displayed on the night of the benefit concert, showing the
            strength in our community against cancer.

        <p class="text regular">
            Inspired by the success of the 2014 campaign, Message in a Melody 2015
            continued to raise funds and awareness for pediatric cancer. Whereas the original
            team only consisted of five amazing members, the team grew to to twenty
            individuals. The team shifted the campaign's focus from music to education and
            awareness on childhood cancer, although music remained an integral part of Message in a
            Melody. The 2015 benefit concert featured

            A Poem by Ashley Jensen-Pray
        </h1>
        <p class="text poem italic">
            She was just another teenage girl,                  <br>
            Filled with youth and curiosity,                    <br>
            One day she came to discover,                       <br>
            What never seemed like a possibility.               <br>
            Her world fell apart like never before,             <br>
            And all she could do was watch idly by,             <br>
            She wanted to run the other way,                    <br>
            But instead she got ready to fight.                 <br>
            She knew she was a fighter,                         <br>
            For her life had never been easy,                   <br>
            But she found an unknown strength within,           <br>
            That not even she could believe.                    <br>
            The cancer tried its hardest,                       <br>
            To wither her away to nothing,                      <br>
            But she had a fire in her eyes,                     <br>
            Her life wasn't for the taking.                     <br>
            She fought her battle every day,                    <br>
            Going through the tunnel to get to the light,       <br>
            She was a warrior with a passion for life,          <br>
            By being relentless, she did it..she won the fight. <br>
            <br>
            -Ashley Jenson-Pray                                 <br>
