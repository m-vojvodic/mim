            </h1>
            <p class="text">
                The Electronic Dance Music Club (EDMC) at UCLA is an on-campus
                organization, founded in 2012 that aims to provide DJ's, producers, and fans with a safe
                space to learn and practice their skills and discuss their interests in the growing music
                field around us. We share our interests and talents with the rest of campus and the Los
                Angeles community by hosting and DJ'ing various events on campus and around LA. We
                have also been able to bring popular artists to our campus for student enjoyment, some of
                which including Singularity, Nutrik, and Paul Oakenfold. As a club, we have grown
                exponentially in the last couple years. Starting last year, we felt that we could use our
                talents for something greater than ourselves. And thus, we put together a campaign to
                benefit the community.

                Message in a Melody is a fundraising campaign and benefit concert
                created by the Electronic Dance Music Club at UCLA. This idea was spearheaded by
                Elizabeth Matusov who was inspired by the courage her high school friend, Ashley
                Jensen-Pray, showed in her fight against a rare form of soft tissue cancer. Although
                Ashley passed away in December 2013, her story lives on with Message in a Melody,
                touching the hearts of all those around her and the entire UCLA community.
                <br><br>
                All members in EDMC have been personally affected by cancer, whether through friends
                or family members. Inspired by Ashley, EDMC members took action as an UCLA
                student group to reach out and bring forth this powerful cause to our fellow peers and
                inspire change. 
                <br><br>
                Last year, Message in a Melody's benefit concert was hosted in the Ackerman Grand
                Ballroom, located on the UCLA Campus on May 26, 2014. Featuring DJ and producer
                Kastle and two student DJ's, BVSD (Marko Vojvodic) and Thom Rugo (Philip Scott),
                the benefit concert was an incredible success, with over 250 attendees. A cancer wall was
                also created in the time leading up to the benefit concert, allowing the UCLA community
                to sign the huge wall for anyone they know that has been affected by cancer. This 
                aggregation of support was displayed on the night of the benefit concert, showing the
                strength in our community against cancer. We are extremely proud to say that the entire
                fundraising campaign, which includes the benefit concert, has raised over $5,000 for the
                Department of Pediatric Oncology at Mattel Children's Hospital.

                This Year: 2015
            </h1>
            <p class="text">
                Inspired by the success of last year's campaign, Message in a Melody
                2015 will continue to raise funds and awareness for pediatric aids. Whereas last year's
                team only consisted of five amazing members, we've expanded our entire staff to twenty
                individuals. We are also shifting the campaign's focus from music to education and
                awareness on childhood cancer, although music is still an integral part of Message in a
                Melody. Due to the increase of staff members, we are able to create a full-blown
                campaign with many more organized events leading up to the benefit concert, such as a
                Kerckhoff Art Gallery Showing, _________________, and transitioning to UCLA Spark
                as our crowdsourcing platform to further engage UCLA students and alumni. This year's
                benefit concert will be in Ackerman Grand Ballroom, located on the UCLA campus, on
                <b>May 6, 2015</b>. Our goal is to surpass the amount of donations fundraised last year and
                evoke an even greater engagement in the UCLA community against pediatric cancer.

                Fundraising efforts and donations will support the research of
                Dr. Theodore Moore, M.D., chief of pediatric hematology-oncology at Mattel Children's
                Hospital, whose cell therapy clinics strives to help bring the recovery rate of pediatric

                A Poem by Ashley Jensen-Pray
            </h1>
            <p class="poem">
                She was just another teenage girl,                  <br>
                Filled with youth and curiosity,                    <br>
                One day she came to discover,                       <br>
                What never seemed like a possibility.               <br>
                Her world fell apart like never before,             <br>
                And all she could do was watch idly by,             <br>
                She wanted to run the other way,                    <br>
                But instead she got ready to fight.                 <br>
                She knew she was a fighter,                         <br>
                For her life had never been easy,                   <br>
                But she found an unknown strength within,           <br>
                That not even she could believe.                    <br>
                The cancer tried its hardest,                       <br>
                To wither her away to nothing,                      <br>
                But she had a fire in her eyes,                     <br>
                Her life wasn't for the taking.                     <br>
                She fought her battle every day,                    <br>
                Going through the tunnel to get to the light,       <br>
                She was a warrior with a passion for life,          <br>
                By being relentless, she did it..she won the fight. <br>
